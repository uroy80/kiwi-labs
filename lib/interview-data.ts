      question: "Your client is a grocery chain experiencing declining profits. How would you approach this problem?",
      sampleAnswer:
        "I would start by analyzing the financial data to identify specific areas of decline. Then I'd examine external factors like market competition and consumer trends, as well as internal factors like operational efficiency and pricing strategy. Based on this analysis, I might recommend solutions such as optimizing the product mix, improving supply chain efficiency, enhancing the customer experience, or exploring new revenue streams like online delivery.",

      question: "Estimate the market size for electric vehicles in the United States for the next 5 years.",
      sampleAnswer:
        "To estimate the market size, I'd start with the current US passenger vehicle market of approximately 275 million vehicles. With annual sales of about 17 million vehicles and an EV adoption rate currently around 5%, that's about 850,000 EVs sold annually. Considering growth factors like government incentives, improving technology, expanding charging infrastructure, and consumer preferences, I'd project an annual growth rate of 25-30% for the next 5 years. This would result in approximately 3.2-3.5 million EVs sold annually by year 5, representing a market size of roughly $160-175 billion (assuming an average price of $50,000 per vehicle).",

      question: "How would you determine if a company should enter the meal kit delivery market?",
      sampleAnswer:
        "I would evaluate this opportunity through several lenses: Market analysis (size, growth, competition), customer analysis (needs, willingness to pay, acquisition costs), operational feasibility (supply chain, logistics, food safety), financial analysis (startup costs, unit economics, path to profitability), and strategic fit (company capabilities, brand alignment). I'd also consider potential risks like market saturation, high customer acquisition costs, and logistical challenges. Based on these factors, I'd recommend whether to enter the market and, if so, what differentiation strategy to pursue.",

      question:
        "A luxury fashion brand wants to expand into a new geographic market. How would you evaluate which market they should enter?",
      sampleAnswer:
        "I would evaluate potential markets using a framework that considers: Market size and growth (GDP per capita, luxury goods spending), competitive landscape (existing luxury brands, market saturation), consumer behavior (cultural affinity for luxury, shopping habits), operational feasibility (supply chain, retail locations, import regulations), and potential risks (economic stability, currency fluctuations, regulatory changes). I would then rank markets based on these criteria, with particular emphasis on the alignment between the brand's positioning and the target market's luxury consumption patterns.",

      question: "How would you estimate the number of gas stations in the United States?",
      sampleAnswer:
        "To estimate the number of gas stations, I'd use a top-down approach. The US has approximately 330 million people with about 275 million registered vehicles. Assuming each vehicle needs to refuel roughly once per week, that's about 275 million refueling events weekly. If an average gas station can handle about 2,000 fill-ups per week (roughly 300 per day), we would need approximately 137,500 gas stations (275,000,000 รท 2,000). This aligns with the actual figure of about 150,000 gas stations in the US, accounting for variations in station size and geographic distribution.",

      question: "What methodologies did you employ in your project, and why were they appropriate?",
      sampleAnswer:
        "I employed a mixed-methods approach combining quantitative data analysis with qualitative interviews. This methodology was appropriate because the research questions required both statistical validation and in-depth understanding of participant experiences. The quantitative component provided measurable outcomes, while the qualitative aspect revealed nuances in how participants interpreted these outcomes.",
